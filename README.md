# kwasm

A Wasm parser and interpreter written in Kotlin.

**I'd also like to specify that I'm using this project to learn Kotlin.
So things may not be written in the best way possible.**

## What can this do right now?

As of now this can only parse binary Wasm.
I'm planning to implement a Wat parser and bytecode interpreter (this last one has
the highest priority).
